																										<blockquote>Late 2014 I experienced a burnout from years of relentless stress and poor lifestyle.  My physical and emotional health got so bad that I ended up bed-ridden for eight days, at my low point.  My doctor was not useful in addressing my health problems and I was suffering a lot (from advanced adrenal fatigue, vision problems and anxiety, among other things). 
 
																Magda has been instrumental in me regaining my health, even though I am still in the process.  She is extremely devoted, caring, reassuring, and encouraging.  She is very confident in her knowledge of health issues, from the big picture, such that I have come to fully trust her advice.  With her support I have made tremendous progress.  She has been extremely supportive, including morally, as I find the path back to good health.  She has an incredible array of resources at her disposal for every situation and symptom, and is very quick and confident to provide the right help. For each resource, she knows the right application. She responds quickly and has a great deal of compassion, and always a positive outlook.  With Magdaâ€™s guidance, I have learned which steps to take toward addressing my health issues and I have gained full confidence in her care and approach. 
 
																From her I have learned a lot about taking care of, and taking responsibility for, my own health.  Magda has been instrumental in me regaining my health.  I absolutely recommend her to anyone who is experiencing health problems, or who is looking to get the most of their health and life. I can safely say, Magda saved me from a dire situation and has given me hope for the future. She has made me a lot more confident in my health and life in general.
